<p class="col-all" id="Chicken">Fried chicken<br><br>Also known as Southern fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used.

The first dish known to have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the European Middle Ages. However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat (though without seasoning). Meanwhile, many West African peoples had traditions of seasoned fried chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil). Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South. </p>

Tender shrimp and fluffy rice cooked all in ONE PAN in under 15 minutes. This garlic and spice infused dish is packed full of flavor and will become a new favorite!

Sometimes you just need a quick no fuss dinner fast. A dinner that will practically cook itself in under 15 minutes? I’m in! This one-pan shrimp and rice is just that. Quick, easy and packed full of flavor.

To make this dish you will need jumbo shrimp that has been deveined and clean, quick cooking rice (basmati or minute rice), onion, garlic, and spices. I like to drizzle some freshly grated parmesan on the dish at the very end but that’s totally optional. For the spices, I like to use the basics; paprika, cumin, salt and pepper. The garlic adds so much flavor and because the rice is cooked in the same broth as the onions and garlic, it will soak up all the flavor! Serve with a side salad and enjoy!  </div>

It is recommended to pair the dish with rice, pigeon peas, and fried plantains.<br>Pit beef is an American barbecue technique originating from Maryland. The technique features beef, usually top round, that's grilled quickly over charcoal, becoming crusty on the exterior while remaining succulent and almost rare on the inside.

The meat is later sliced into thin strips and often used as a sandwich stuffing, preferably on Kaiser rolls or rye bread. The sauce for Maryland pit beef contains horseradish instead of the usual barbecue sauces based on ketchup, vinegar, and brown sugar.

It is believed that pit beef first started gaining popularity in the 1970s in Baltimore's working-class neighborhoods. </div>
